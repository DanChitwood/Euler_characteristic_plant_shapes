# Euler_characteristic_plant_shapes
A repository for code and data analyzing plant shapes using the Euler characteristic transform (ECT)

**Figure 1: Euler characteristic transform (ECT) converts graphs into images. A)** Graph-representations of cut-outs from *The Parakeet and the Mermaid* (Henri Matisse, 1952). Vertices of each shape graph are plotted in black along the outline.
