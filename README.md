**Figure 1: Euler characteristic transform (ECT) converts graphs into cylindrical images. A)** Graph-representations of cut-outs from *The Parakeet and the Mermaid* (Henri Matisse, 1952). Vertices of each shape graph are plotted in black along the outline. **B)** Rotation of a shape graph (top) and corresponding ECT images (middle) and cylindrical representations (bottom). Cylindrical padding created by corresponding regions "A" and "B" and zero padding for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are indicated. Euler characteristic ($\chi$) color values are shown. **C)** t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), **D)** uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), and **E)** potential of heat-diffusion for affinity-based trajectory embedding (PHATE) embeddings of principal component analysis (PCA)-normalized ECT images. Shapes and corresponding colors are projected onto embeddings for visualization purposes.

**Figure 2: Shapes and associated Euler characteristic transform (ECT) images. A)** Randomly selected leaf and **B)** pavement cell shapes and corresponding ECT images. Species names and Euler characteristic ($\chi$) color values are provided.
