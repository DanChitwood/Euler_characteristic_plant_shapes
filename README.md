# Euler_characteristic_plant_shapes
A repository for code and data analyzing plant shapes using the Euler characteristic transform (ECT)

**Figure 1: Euler characteristic transform (ECT) converts graphs into images. A)** Graph-representations of cut-outs from *The Parakeet and the Mermaid* (Henri Matisse, 1952). Vertices of each shape graph are plotted in black along the outline. **B)** Rotation of a shape graph (top) and corresponding ECT images (middle) and cylindrical representations (bottom). Cylindrical padding created by corresponding regions "A" and "B" and zero padding for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is indicated. Euler characteristic values ($\chi$) color values are shown. **C)** t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), **D)** uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), and **E)** potential of heat-diffusion for affinity-based trajectory embedding (PHATE) embeddings of principal component analysis (PCA)-normalized ECT images. Shapes and corresponding colors are projected onto embeddings for visualization purposes.
